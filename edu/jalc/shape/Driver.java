/*The driver should demonstrate use of polymorphism by comparing
different object instances. Your driver should have at least one
of each of your instantiable classes. You should be able to compare
these objects to see if they are of equal area. That means if I had
a rectangle with a height of 10 and a width of 2, it should equal a
triangle with a height of 10 and a base of 4.
